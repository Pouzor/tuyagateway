TuyaMQTT
==================

Listens on MQTT topic and routes requests to Tuya devices, based on a one to one topic translation. In v1.1 Tuya device configuration can be done with [MQTT Devices](https://github.com/TradeFace/mqttdevices). TuyaMQTT uses [TuyaFace](https://github.com/TradeFace/tuya) to communicate locally (no cloud connection needed) with your tuya devices.
